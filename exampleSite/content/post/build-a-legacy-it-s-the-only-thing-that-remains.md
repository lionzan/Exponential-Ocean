Last week a friend of mine died in a road accident. Shimrit was an Ocean lover and co-founder of [ECOncrete](https://econcretetech.com/), an innovative startup in Ocean Sustainability.

She invented and developed a type of concrete block to be used for building coastal breakwaters instead of traditional methods, which promotes the formation of bio-habitats where normally there would have been a concrete desert.

Shimrit is no more, but her legacy lives on and her impact on Ocean Sustainability will be massive and will last forever.

Let her memory inspire all of us. Our lives can finish in a moment and the only thing that remains is our legacy. Shimrit legacy is enormous and should inspire all of us to **work for a mission bigger than ourselves**.

Thank you Shimrit.

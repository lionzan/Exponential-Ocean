This is not just abut creativity. It's about how you approach life. We are creative spirits and much too often we lock our creative spirit inside, while responding to external pressures, needs and demands. When we respond, fight back or try to force a result, we think we are in control, but we are just responding to these external pressures. Why so?

It's because we think and overthink stuff, and we react to the constructs that we think in our head. What if we thought just for a moment that **we are thinking the thoughts to which we react with our feelings**. The stuff that make us suffer is just the thought that we have about what is happening outside us. 

Try it for a moment, just as an experiment, you don't need to believe in it or that it will work. Just observe that when something hits you from outside, you first think of it and then react to that thought with your feelings. Just observe this phenomenon for a day.

When you do this, you are able to mute your feelings or at least understand that they are a construct of your mind. And you open the doors to your inner creative spirit to react to whatever is thrown at you with a completely different attitude. 

Your inner creative spirit knows what is best for you at any moment, if you only let it speak. Allow it to unfold while events outside unfold around you. The least you think the more "in the flow" you can be, listening to your inner creative spirit and unfolding your life.

This changes everything.

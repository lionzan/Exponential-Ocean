A bright and windy Saturday morning!

It calls for some ramblings about setting ambitious goals ...and have a laugh at my quick maths skills in the video ;)

With less-than-ambitious goals you will achieve only as much, and you will give yourself a false sense of accomplishment and permission to rest on your laurels after you accomplish them.

Here's my ambitious goal:

> I want to multiply my impact on Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation by 100,000!

Are you frustrated for not doing enough for Ocean Sustainability and decarbonisation? Let's have a chat!

Duration: 5 minutes instead of the usual 2, but it's weekend!

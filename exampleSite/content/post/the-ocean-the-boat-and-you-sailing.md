Life, the world and everything in it is like an Ocean. It is vast, immense and all encompassing. Our experience of the ocean is like a sailing boat, a tool to navigate it and sense it. And we on the sailing boat decide how to sail it. We decide how to feel about the ocean and what to do with whatever the Ocean looks like in every single moment of our lives.  
  
There is no good or bad day, there is no good or bad ocean, it just is and you experience it through your boat. What you do with your boat is your choice and how you see the ocean while you do it is also your choice. A strong westerly wind looks good if you are sailing Eastwards, it looks worse if you are sailing westward. But also there, you might well enjoy beating against the wind, it is very exciting!  
  
In the end it is all about how you decide to do and feel about what the ocean is at the moment. Because it just IS.

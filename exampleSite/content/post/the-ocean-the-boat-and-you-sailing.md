Life, the world and everything in it is like an Ocean. It is vast, immense and all encompassing. Our experience of the Ocean is like a sailing yacht, a tool to navigate it and sense it. And the skipper on the yacht decides how to sail it. We decide how to feel about the Ocean and what to do with whatever the Ocean looks like in every single moment of our lives.

There is no good or bad day, there is no good or bad ocean, it just is and you experience it through your boat. What you do with your boat is your choice and how you see the ocean while you do it is also your choice.

A strong Westerly wind looks good if you are sailing Eastwards, it looks worse if you are sailing Westwards. But also there, you might well enjoy beating against the wind, it is very exciting!

In the end it is all about what you decide to do and how you decide to feel about what the Ocean is in that very moment. **Because it just IS**.

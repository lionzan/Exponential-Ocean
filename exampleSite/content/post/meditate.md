TM/Ayurvedic – empty mind (paid)

Advanced Yoga Practices – empty mind (free, online)

Mindfulness – feel in union with the world

Path of Least Resistance – find and be driven by End Result

Are we solving past issues/tensions or focusing on the ER?

PLR – start from "I don't know" and go towards my ER, past not defines

easy vs effortless

A clear End Result that guides us as a beacon is essential to achieve something in life. Without knowing where you want to go, it's very difficult to get anywhere!

Your End Result is what you are willing to do for its own sake. Not because you need to or have to. Not because you respond to your fears. Just something that you want to do for the sake of it. Use it as a beacon in all you do!

When following your ER, you are actually leading towards it, and it feels powerful and unstoppable. With an ER, you see everything that happens to you under a different lens, the lens of making the ER happen, so you spot opportunities that otherwise you would have passed upon.

It feels like you are creating these opportunities. In a sense yes, but don't be fooled by words, it's not magic, the opportunity was there, but this time you can spot it and leverage it to get closer to your ER.

What is your beacon?

With a big issue like Sustainability and Decarbonisation it is easy to get caught into the trap of analysing what is wrong and who is the culprit.

But this attitude is not productive. We must instead focus on what we can choose to do ourselves. Any action, even the tiniest will produce more results than just complaining about a poor state of things.

If anyways we are still obsessed with the causes of a dire state of affairs, let's ask ourselves, what can I choose to do to change, to address those causes?

It is about what **ACTION** I can take to make things change!

Sometimes as individuals we feel overwhelmed at the scale of the task of restoring the ocean environment. We feel we can do just so much yet we need to do much more. 

As individuals we might tend to feel so powerless that we don't even try since we feel our impact is so insignificant. So my question is, how can we multiply our impact and feel that we are actually making a dent? 

Well, we can, we just need to change our mindset. It's not about what I can do individually, as much as how can I multiply my impact tenfold, a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold. 

With a different mindset we can do it. Ask yourself, how can I leverage my assets to achieve it? How can I leverage my networks of friends, colleagues, business partners. How can I leverage my position in society. How can I leverage my money, why not. How can I leverage my time. 

This is what I help Powerful Ocean Lovers to achieve.

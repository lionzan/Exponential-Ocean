A simple 4-choices question: how do you show up in life? Are you a victim to whom everything happens, or a Warrior who fights back against all difficulties, or a Monk secluded in a personal cocoon of good feelings, or a Creator?  
  
Life does not just "happen to" creators. They are an active part in the creation of life. Together with all the rest of humanity, the sun, the planets, the entire universe, the laws of physics, all th ethings that determine what will happen next. Creators realise they are part of the continuous creative act, and they act as such. They create, with whatever they have at hand, with ingenuity and love, to create what they deeply want to create.  
  
How powerful a distinction!

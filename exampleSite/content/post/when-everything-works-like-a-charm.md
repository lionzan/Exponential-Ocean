Have you ever experienced those moments of bliss when everything goes exactly as needed for you to achieve some great result?

Sometimes we think it's just chance, other times we might also believe that a guardian angel is with us, or that we are special and things always turn out well for us. But we don't understand really why is it so.

Well, in those moments we are simply in the flow with our life and the things that happen around us. We have a clear objective and we know where we stand, so that we can see everything that happens around us with different eyes and we spot the things that can help us. Even more, we create things and situations with our actions, that will drive us towards the desired result. It's no magic, just the ability to let go of fears and be fully connected to our inner goal.

Why let our fears derail us, instead of enjoying the bliss of being in the flow?

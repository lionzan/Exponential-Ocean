Sure, if you have half-a-glass of beer you can choose whether you want to look at it as half-empty or half-full. And your words will determine your worldview. The half-full perspective is much more empowering and sets in motion a chain of good thoughts...

### But for me this alternative has always felt limiting.

I asked myself, Why should I accept half-a-glass to start with? What can I do to have a full-full glass? Is it really impossible? Should I take it as an unchangeable given? Or **is there something I can do to enjoy not half a glass, but a full one**?

This is the attitude of **possibility**, of **creating** what you really want, rather than accepting or taking for granted anything that life throws at us â€“Â or more precisely, anything that we attract for ourselves. If I say it's a half-full glass, I am substantially accepting whatever happened with a passive stance yet a good outlook.

Conversely, as soon as I ask myself, what can I do to change things, to change what I get from life, what life I create for myself, **an entire world of possibilities opens up**!

### Always ask yourself, is that all I can get, is this what I created for myself? Or can I create something bigger, better, more impactful? Don't settle for half-full!

We all consider ourselves responsible people. Yet time and again we decide not to take responsibility for our actions. 

Any time we do something wrong and we use some external reason to excuse our behaviour, we are not taking responsibility. But our actions are our own choice. Always. And if we took the wrong action due to some external force, it's still our responsibility. This sounds relevant in some court setting, but we often forget about it in real life. 

Taking responsibility for our actions is a powerful decision that we can take, because it makes us the masters of our lives. By taking responsibility we affirm that our lives, our decisions, our deeds are totally of our own and we don't release power on them to anything or anyone else. Pretty powerful huh?

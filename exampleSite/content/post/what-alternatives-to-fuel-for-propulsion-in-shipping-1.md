What alternatives to fuel propulsion exist? Which type of energy is available for free on the Ocean? Solar? Sure. Any other idea?

Exactly it's #Wind! Wind is abundant, free, and delivered at the point of use. It can contribute to reduce dramatically our reliance on fossil fuel by providing free propulsion energy during long passages.

Many technologies are being developed, ranging from traditional sails, to rigid composite sails, to Flettner rotors and other rotating devices, to kites (which in the video I call paraglides because in fact they look very much like those special kites).

Many technologies with different needs and challenges, yet all already available and developing further. Wind has the potential to have a real impact on ship propulsion already today, to help us in the transition to net-zero propulsion.

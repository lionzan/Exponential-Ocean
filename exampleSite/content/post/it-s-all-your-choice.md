The actions you take are your choice. Plain and simple. There's no "I did this because... and I couldn't do anything about it because that's how I am." But that's not all. Your ability to choose goes well beyond that.  
  
The way you feel in reaction to what happens to you is all in your head. You can choose to feel as you prefer. Sounds preposterous "that's preposterous!" but it's true. The way you feel is the reaction to thoughts that happen in your brain. It's either thoughts that appear in your brain, or thoughts that are triggered by external events. Either case it's thoughts, and you react to those fabrications of your brain with your feelings. You are no more happy or sad than what you think you are.  
  
So when negative thoughts strike, you have the power, the choice, to decide how do you react to them, remember they are fabrications of your brain.

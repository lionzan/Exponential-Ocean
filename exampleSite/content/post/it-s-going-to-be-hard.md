Even with an ER, you will have the tension to do things guided by fear. You will be afraid, you will suffer, yet you will do the right thing because it's the one leading to your ER.

You will crave chocolate, you will want to stay in bed,you will want to procrastinate. Only thing, you won't because your ER demands something else.

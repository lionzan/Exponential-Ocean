If you want to achieve anything, you need first to have clear what is that you want to achieve, as I already mentioned in [another post](/post/how-to-materialise-the-things-you-need-to-achieve-your-objective/). But **what is that you want to achieve**?

Let's run a powerful exercise (credit to Warren Buffet for the exercise apparently, whom I found quoted for this exercise in several places): Ask yourself **which are the 25 things that you want to achieve before you die** and list them. Take your time to think it through, these are the 25 things you want to do before you die, nothing less! Then write the list down.

Now identify the 5 most important items in that list, those that really you want to achieve should everything else fail. Highlight them in the list.

Finally ask yourself, what should I do with the other 20?

Actually no, let me tell you: **avoid the other 20 like hell**. Don't think of these objectives, don't do anything to achieve them and focus exclusively on the top 5 if you really want to achieve them.

> Every time spent on an objective which is not in the top 5 is actually delaying the achievement of **all** your objectives.

But don't despair! As soon as you complete one of the top 5, add the top one of the last 20 to the top 5 list and keep going. Also in this occasion please add one more thing to the list, you never want to end up with an empty list (as in "nothing left to do before I die" :/)

So, keep always max 5 (someone says 8) top objectives in your life and spend all your time and energy to achieve them, leaving behind everything else. You'll be able to catch up later.

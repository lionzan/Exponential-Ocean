I've been thinking whether to include LNG as an alternative to fossil fuels for propulsion. IN fact, it IS a fossil fuel, yet with some benefits that might reasonably help us to reduce emissions in line with IMO guidelines. So it looks the perfect solution, doesn't it?  
  
Certainly it is the short- and medium-term solution to comply with regulations. However our objective is not to just comply, it is to stop global warming by eliminating emissions from fossil fuels in the long run. LNG obviously can't help for being itself a fossil fuel.  
  
Moreover, and more worryingly, by converting our fleet to LNG we would reduce the pressure on the industry to find zero-carbon solutions. And we would continue business almost as usual, inevitably delaying the development of alternative zero carbon fuels, which is the main priority.

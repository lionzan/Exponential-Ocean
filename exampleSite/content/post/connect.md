Connect - who would I love to speak to today? Just for the sake of it. not for some specific objective or outcome.

be genuinely curious

Invite - would you like some help with that? [https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=1892](https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=1892 "https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=1892")

let's have a 20' chat

* what you want to achieve
* what is stopping you
* what have you done about it

the decide whether you want to continue with a proper 2 hrs coaching session

have a menu of alternatives [https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=2374](https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=2374 "https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=2374")

* one very expensive, the $1000 hamburger on the menu [https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M](https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M "https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M") (hook the price high)
* a year work together
* 13 weeks work together
* a one day intensive.

your job is to audition clients not the other way round

scorecards to assess customers

be an amateur at what you do, it is powerful, you don't need to know the rules [https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=3279](https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=3279 "https://youtu.be/kb7lA5gyJ2M?t=3279") willingness to break the rules

what will make this an extraordinary conversation

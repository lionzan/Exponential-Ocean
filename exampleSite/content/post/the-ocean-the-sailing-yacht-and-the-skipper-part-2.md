Continuing with yesterday metaphor about the Ocean, the Sailing Yacht and the Skipper, you can decide how you sail across the Ocean, where you want to go and which marks you want to put on the map to guide you in your journey towards the objective. 

It's all your **choice**, and if reaching a mark with a direct route might be difficult or impossible, you can always **decide** to change tack and approach it through a different path. 

In the end it is all about how you decide to do and feel about what the ocean is at the moment. Because it just IS.

Are you frustrated for not doing enough for Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation? Let's have a chat!

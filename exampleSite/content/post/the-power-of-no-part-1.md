Who is trying to deflect you from your end result? You should weight very carefully every request you get which is not aligned with it.

Why do you say yes and accept to spend time and energy on a goal that is not yours? What can you do about it? Well, the most obvious answer is, learn to say NO!

This is what Steve Jobs did when he went back to Apple and found a company where everybody was working on their own project, and no-one aligned with Apple's end result. He set a clear end result and requested everybody to live by it. He said NO to tons of interesting projects that were not aligned with the end result. Sure his employees had to choose and some also said NO to him and left the company. (check this [Steve Jobs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8eP99neOVs)... after you play my vid of course! ;)

Are you frustrated for not doing enough for Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation? Let's have a chat!

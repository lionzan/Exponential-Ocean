I've been doing a few webinars recently on how we can multiply our impact on Ocean Sustainability. It seems that it's such a complex issue that is mostly in the hands of industry and regulators, and that our individual action is of very little impact.

In the webinar I challenge participants to think beyond their immediate actions towards Ocean Sustainability, like reducing plastic consumption and increasing the use of sustainable energy. There is just so much that we can do individually. But we can multiply our impact by leveraging our other assets like our personal and professional networks, or supporting charities active in Ocean sustainability, or leveraging our position as business leaders to move entire companies become more sustainable.

What can you do to multiply your impact on Ocean sustainability?

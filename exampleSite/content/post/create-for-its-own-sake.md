I hear a recurring question about how to recognise a real End Result vs. something that we just think we need to do. Create for its own sake is 2 secrets in one about how to recognise your real end results.

First, you recognise you are after a true End result when you do it for its own sake. That is, you do it regardless of the outcome, you just do it because you want to create it. And of course you will feel exhilarated when you will complete it, but even if you won't be able to complete it, you will be happy to have engaged with it any ways.

Second, consider not only the object of the creation for its own sake, but the act of creation itself. That is, create for its own sake, create for the sake of creating. How powerful is this! Be a creator, almost irrespective of what, and enjoy the act of creation. Automatically you are doing something that is worth it!

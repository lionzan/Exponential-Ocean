The more NOs you learn to receive the stronger it makes you. The more you are asking the more NOs you will get.

build your no muscle. go out and ask something excessive to someone you don't know - say a free coffee at the coffee shop - and repeat it again and again. build your no muscle.

moreover, learn to ask without asking, almost as stating a fact, without embellishments, from a position of power. you'll be surprised at how many times it works.

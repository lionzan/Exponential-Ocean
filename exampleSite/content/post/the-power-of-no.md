Being able to say NO is important. But if you want to push innovative ideas and change, being able to **hear a NO** is even more important!  
  
We are wired to protect ourselves, and receiving a NO is perceived as a threat that we should try to avoid. So we try to convince the other part with all means to say yes, or alternatively we just avoid the interaction. But there is another way. We can train to hear NO, receive it and just go ahead to the next challenge.  
  
Better get a NO than not trying at all!  
  
And even better, every NO we get, makes us stronger and unbeatable when faced with further NOs. Because if we look for a yes, we might need to pass through a thousand NOs. So better to train to receive NOs!

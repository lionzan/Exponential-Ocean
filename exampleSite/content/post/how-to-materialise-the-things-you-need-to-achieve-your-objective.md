Or, "How to materialise the things you need in order to achieve your objective" which in fact looks like magic.

Well the simple answer is, "have a clear objective in mind."

When you have a clear objective in mind, you make sense of the things that happen to you and around you in relationship to that objective. So you spot what could help you achieve the objective. Which you wouldn't be able to spot if the objective was not clear.

The magic is only apparent, not real. Or to say it in another way the magic is always there, but it's up to you to see it.

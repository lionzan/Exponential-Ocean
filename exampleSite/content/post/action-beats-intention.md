Let's have our intention clear, but even if we don't have it absolutely clear, let's take action. True, we might know where we want to move towards yet we don't know how to get there. Even so, let's not fantasise about how we could get there, and plan it over and again without acting. Rather, act and take the first step out in the world. 

Don't keep your intention secluded in your mind, give it life by taking action!

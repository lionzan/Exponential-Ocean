In the Unknown You Need a a Compass Not a Map.

We are so obsessed with planning and execution that when we are sailing in new waters we want to determine the ideal route and go with it. But we don't even know the waters we are sailing in! What we need when we are innovating and exploring, is a compass to give us the direction we want to move, not the exact details of the route.

Planning and execution fail every time we are in the unknown. Here is where we have to resort to defining a general direction and then using a compass to move towards it. And this is done by remaining attuned to the environment we are moving in, by experimenting and learning while we move forward.

Our task then becomes to set a new path. Isn't that great?

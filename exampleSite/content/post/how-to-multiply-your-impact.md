We have an immense potential to create and have an impact. Most often we stop ourselves in the track because of fears or limiting beliefs.

What is that you can do to multiply your impact on sustainability beyond the things that you can do as an individual? OK less plastic, OK go electric, but the impact is just one. How can you multiply your impact by 10x 100x or 1000x?

There are millions of ways, and everyone can discover their own one. But I want to inspire those who want to multiply their impact and don't know how to do it. I want to inspire them with the example of other people who managed to find a way.

Are you one of these people who found a way to multiply their impact? If you think so, I would love to interview you, hear first hand how you did it, and inspire other people to find their own way!

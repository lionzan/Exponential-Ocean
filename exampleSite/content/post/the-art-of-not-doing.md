Too often we feel overwhelmed by the million things we "have to do", or so we think. We feel that if we don't do them all we will be somehow betraying ourselves. And we suffer form this sense of guilt.

Ironically, feeling guilty does not support our wellbeing which is fundamental for us to be successful at doing the things that matter. In a future video I will talk about this tension. 

Today I want to remind ourselves that it is good to stop being obsessed by doing and take a break of not-doing. How does it feel, how can you do this not-doing? It is a kind of meditation in which you let your thoughts go and do nothing. Just observe, yourself, the environment around you. You just observe but don't act on it, nor "think" about it. You see a bird flying and you just see it, without even watching with intent. You see it and you feel the beauty of it. You can feel the beauty of everything that is around you.

But also of the things that are inside you. Your thoughts and feelings. They come and go. You don't have much control on them, aside of reinforcing them and obsessively reliving them. Or acting on them. But there is also another thing you can do with them. Just observe them as they come and go. The same as you would do with the bird flying in front of you. Just observe, and do-nothing.

Even just few minutes of this exercise every day can help you to learn how to look or hear your inner thoughts and feelings, without being caught by them. Which is an essential ingredient to allow your inner creator be and express him/herself.

Quick video-post today about how we decide to navigate our life. As if we were sailors sailing our yacht of consciousness in the Ocean of possibilities.

We can sail as Tourists, just to enjoy the breeze without any particular destination.

Or we can do it as Explorers, setting objectives to visit this or that place and then accomplishing them.

Or as Challengers, who have a big objective like sail across the Atlantic as fast as possible.

Which kind of sailor are you? What are you doing with your life? Would you like to go to the next level?

Are you frustrated for not doing enough for Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation? Let's have a chat!

Several times in my career I had to take a decision about a very interesting business or job opportunity, which had some ethical downside. Should I take it or should I walk away? I consistently made what I considered to be the right choice, that is, stay ethical and walk away.

Certainly a safe choice. But let's look at it from a different angle: I knew there was something dodgy and **if I accepted the business opportunity or job I would have been in the position to do something about it**.

To help the organisation get rid of dodgy practices, by taking charge of the problem and sorting it out. Worst case scenario, the organisation wouldn't want it and pushed back, maybe even fired me. So what? That would be the moment to walk away, not earlier.

**But what if I really managed to change the organisation for the better? How much more impactful my contribution would have been?**

### Take Charge!

The lesson for me is simple yet powerful. Take charge! If something is wrong in your work, business, family, don't just walk away, take charge to make it right. You might be able to do it and **have a much greater impact**!

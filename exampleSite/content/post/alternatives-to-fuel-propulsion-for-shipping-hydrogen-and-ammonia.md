Now we are talking! Hydrogen and ammonia seem to be the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels for propulsion on the long run. The main issue with these is the production of the fuel itself, which today is mostly done by converting fossil fuels, hence having a negative impact on the environment. The alternative to produce hydrogen is electrolysis, thus using only electricity. This process is zero carbon as long as the electric energy it uses is so.

And here is the main issue that we are facing: the availability of enough green electricity to produce all the hydrogen we need. This is a big challenge which will require a massive increase in green energy production plants, like the promising floating find farms, and will compete for green energy for other applications. 

But the opportunity is there, we need to focus our investments towards the development of a strong infrastructure for producing green energy at massive scale. No small feat, but at least it's clear we have to go down that way.

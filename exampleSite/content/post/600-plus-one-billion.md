600 Plus One Billion. That's the annual cost of accidents in maritime: 600 lives lost and $1bn financial losses.  
  
That is to say, that is the cost of inadequacy of current safety and risk management practices. these have improve year on year till 2012 and since then no further improvement has been achieved. Safety and Risk Management have reached a plateau. This is partly due to the increasing complexity of industrial and shipping operations and partly to the fact that the traditional approach to safety has been fully optimised. That is all what the approach can give.  
  
But industry and society ask for more safety and better risk management to improve working conditions, reduce risk of accidents to people, reduce financial risk and recently also environmental risk. Fortunately technology has also advanced and now new technologies are available that can change the approach to safety form preventive to proactive.

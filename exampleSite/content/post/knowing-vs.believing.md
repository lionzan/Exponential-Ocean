You don't just believe in yourself, believe that you can accomplish anything. You know it deep inside, and you have always known it.

The infinite possibilities of your life are out there. And you know that you can achieve them since when you were a child. Actually at that time you knew that everything was possible, you just forgot it, or "they" made you think that it was not possible. Or your chimp inside.

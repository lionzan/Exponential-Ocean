What's My Next Move? You just need to learn to listen to your intuition, because you know much better than you think.

Your intuition is able to work at its best when 2 factors coincide:

1. you have a clear idea of where you want to go, and
2. you have a clear picture of where you are right now.

And if you want to boost your intuition even further, make sure you are in a quiet, not stressed state. And you can get there with a number of techniques that we will cover in a future episode.

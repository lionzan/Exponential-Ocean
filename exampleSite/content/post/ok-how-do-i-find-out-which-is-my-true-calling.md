Just for the sake of it. That's how what drives you when you do something that you really want to do, your end result, your true calling.

OK, How Do I Find Out Which is My True Calling? You know it already, but it is hidden by your fears, that keep you in the endless cycle of solving problems rather than creating what you really want.

What's the difference between responding to fears and external pressure, vs. responding to your own end result, which you do just for the sake of it?

When you respond to external pressures and fears, you are actually going in circles. As soon as you resolve the tension to respond to fear, the fear vanishes, and you lose all the incentives to keep going. So you fall back again. So fear comes back and drives you again for another round.

What about external pressures then? These are just fears in disguise. You need to respond to external pressures for fear. Fear of missing out, fear of not being enough, fear of self-worth. 

The alternative is to respond to your inner calling, to your end result. This is something you do for its own sake. You keep going towards achieving it and there is no fear involved. And when you finally achieve it you are complete. There's no bad place to fall back into. You are ready for your next end result, your next creation.

What if your end result does not happen eventually. Well, it can be because you didn't really believe in it or for some other external reason. But wait a minute! If there's an external reason which stops you from achieving it, what about going around it? You still have the choice!

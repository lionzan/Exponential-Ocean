We hear a constant stream of thoughts in our heads. Some we "decide" to think, most just come and it's us who decide to fixate on them or not. And where do they come from?

Those that we decide to think come from our rational mind, whereas those that just appear come from our more primitive mind, the one responsible for our Ego and our fears. It's the thoughts of worry, fear, preoccupation, that most often we decide to listen and fixate on them, repeating them time and again.

But reality is different. Thoughts are just in our head, and as Michael Neill says, we are just one thought away from happiness. Quite literally. We are happy because of a certain thought of ours, and sad or nervous because of some other thought.

So thoughts in our mind are just an incessant background noise and we decide what to do with it. If we manage to not give it too much importance, we might be able to hear what's humming behind, that is our creator inside, our creative spirit, that brings us the insight before thoughts.

Allow that creative spirit to flow freely!

It's just an excuse to allow your fears win over your higher self. It happens when you don't have a clear End Result in that area.

Say, eating unhealthy food. I can't manage to stop eating chocolate, is just because your health End Result is not clear in your mind.

Stop making excuses and take control of your actions towards your End Result! "That's How I Am, I can't do anything about it" is the most powerful excuse to not express our greatness.

It's an excuse of your fears that stop you from taking action, it's how your fears take control over you. How is that possible? It's because you don't have a clear End result in that area. A beacon that guides you and orients you. Without that, you are actually lost in the fog, and the fears take over. They make you freeze, or do the wrong things.

A clear end result instead helps you see the real objectives for yourself, those that you want to achieve for their own sake. For these, there's no pushback from fear that works. Sure you are afraid, you feel negative tensions, but you just face your fear and keep going toward your end result. That is how powerful you can be!

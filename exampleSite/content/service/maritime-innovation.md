* You run a successful **shipping company** and you know it's time to move it forward and innovate. But you don't know how to do it.
* You are aware that just hiring an innovation manager might be good for your image but **is not enough**.
* You keep asking yourself _"How can I become innovative to stay competitive, without destroying my company in the process?"_

We might want to have a chat.

I  help **shipping company leaders** like you in these times of change, to

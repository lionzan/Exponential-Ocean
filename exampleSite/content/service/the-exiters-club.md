The Exiters Club is an invite-only group of entrepreneurs who managed to get to an Exit for their startups or are in the process of doing it. The objective is to provide mutual support in this delicate phase of an entrepreneur's and startup's life...

* before it happens, to know which are the traps and greatest headaches ahead, and come prepared to sort them out;
* after it happened, to reorganise your thoughts and see with clarity what next.

The pre-Exit period is a very demanding time that needs to be managed carefully, and who can support you best than someone who did it already?

The post-Exit period is a critical junction in an entrepreneur's life, who all of a sudden find him/herself in front of the opportunity of starting afresh, while seriously depleted of energy and full of questions:

* what should I do next
* how can I spend my time productively
* as a successful entrepreneur I have to carefully decide where I put my energy next to avoid wasting it
* etc.

**I am building this group around a number of friends-entrepreneurs who made it, with the intent to create a powerful vision for the future for all of them.**

If you are reading this I should have already invited you to join. If for any reason I did not and you think you belong here or you would like to know more, just get in touch with me on [exiters@zangrando.com](mailto:exiters@zangrando.com)

Looking forward to have you in this group of exceptional people!

Yours  
Leonardo

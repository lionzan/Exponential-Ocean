I discovered Pretotyping in 2011 while teaching Lean Startup and Innovation at the Master in Complex Actions of the renowned international science postgraduate school "International School of Advanced Studies" in Trieste.

I was teaching techniques for early validation of innovation ideas, but I was not happy with the suggestions coming from the "official" lean startup movement. I found these too generic, so I started looking for alternatives and I found about Alberto Savoia and his "Pretotype it" booklet. That was exactly what I had been looking for.

_Pretotyping is a **framework and set of practices and tools** on how to **address innovation in organisations** by **multiplying the number of innovations tested** while at the same time **dramatically reducing the cost of innovation** (i.e. new product failures)._

The following year I spent a month in Silicon Valley, networking with the startup and innovation community to exchange educational techniques for entrepreneurship, and of course I met the man, Alberto. In that occasion I decided to translate the MVP booklet to Italian and I did it in 6 evenings while still in SV: an MVP shouldn't take long to execute!

The Italian translation went on Kindle and later on was published as a physical book on Amazon. I must admit it is still selling well, in spite of the relatively small dimension of the Italian market!

Fast forward a couple of years and I moved to London, where I started Pretotype Company Ltd, the first pretotyping company in Europe, soon followed by the Danish [Preeto](https://pree.to/) by the other European pretotyping guru Tim Vang (congrats Tim for the amazing steps forward you made!)

With the Pretotype Company I worked with some of the most prestigious corporates in Europe to bring an innovation mindset within the organisation, based on pretotyping. Among my clients I had the giant retailer Tesco, the BBC, booking.com, Fremantle Media and many others. We also collaborated with Google's CSI:Lab (Creative Skills for Innovation), to develop a programme on innovation for their G2G programme.

I deliver keynote speeches on Pretotyping and advise organisations on how to make the best use of Pretotyping, for real, long-term change, to embrace innovation across the company while keeping the cost of innovation (i.e. new product failures) the lowest possible.

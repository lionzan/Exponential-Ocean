Dear Leader,

I am interviewing leaders who have a multiplicative impact on Ocean Sustainability, to inspire other people, leaders, CEOs, entrepreneurs, philanthropists and companies to multiply their own impact.

People tend to think that they can do just so much for Ocean Sustainability with their individual actions, and I want to inspire them with examples of people like you who managed to multiply their impact exponentially.

I would like to invite you to an interview with me, to talk about this and help me inspire other people to find their own way to multiply their impact. Please reach out via [leaders@zangrando.com](mailto:leaders@zangrando.com "leaders@zangrando.com") and let's multiply our impact even further.

I look forward to speaking soon.

All the best

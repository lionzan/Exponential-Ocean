I am a Consultant, Advisor and Coach with a passion for the Ocean.

I help CEOs, Entrepreneurs, Philanthropists and Powerful People multiply their personal impact on Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation.

[Powerful People](/you) are people who **think bigger that themselves** and want to **leave a mark on life**. These are my preferred clients, the only ones I choose to work with. I help them

* gain **clarity of their own End Result**
* discover their **unique individual approach to it**
* uncover their **power to multiply their Impact**

I work [**One-to-One**](plans) with individual clients and run [**Sustainability Mastermind Groups**](plans), with[ **integrity**, **transparency** and **out-of-the-box thinking**](working-together), to help Powerful People achieve an exponential impact on Ocean sustainability.

## Who is Leonardo

I am a profoundly curious creative thinker with a bias for action. I always ask myself **Why-What-How**: _“Why things are how they are, what can we do to change them for the better, how can we take action now?“_

I am known in the maritime sector as the founder of [Startup Wharf](https://startupwharf.com), the first ever niche community of maritime startups, which has become a reference for the industry, helping startups make the maritime sector more sustainable.

I have repeatedly been a trailblazer in adopting technical innovation, process innovation and business innovation that eventually became new standards.

* I was the first to adopt digital technologies to design a ship’s hull in a way that made its manufacturing a great deal cheaper.
* I was the first to bring the Lean Startup concepts to Europe and launched a Lean Startup entrepreneurship course in parallel with the first similar course by Steve Blank in Silicon Valley.
* I turned around complex operations in a container terminal running 24/7 by successfully changing the infrastructure, tools and operating model on the go.

#### A Curious Creative Thinker With a Bias for Action

When I was a child I used to read a lot and asked millions of why and how questions. I was always thinking how to make things. As a pastime with my cousins, we would design and build new board games for us to play when we got tired of the existing ones. I always kept my hands dirty by inventing and making objects using wood, steel, aluminium. The emotion of seeing an object that I envisioned, take shape under my hands is indescribable. The joy of using it day after day is ineffable.

I am a visionary who’s often been called a romantic by my colleagues, **and I always took it as a compliment!** Of course I have also been misunderstood, taken advantage of, betrayed, and at times bullied. That’s a price that I would pay again and again to be able to do the things that I did in my life.

The few times in my career when I chose money over passion I paid a hefty price. I need to follow my passion to gain the most, both personally and financially! Today I have a couple of moonshots that I want to achieve (who knows what will come next!):

* I want to achieve an exponential impact on Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation
* I want to sail solo on a route that no-one ever sailed before...

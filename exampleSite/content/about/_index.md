I work with [**people who think bigger than themselves and want to leave a mark on life**](/you). I help them to go beyond their past successes and multiply their impact exponentially. I help them become powerful like the Ocean.

Even highly successful people have unspoken fears and frustrations that hold them back from achieving a much greater impact. I help them uncover their highest, unthinkable aspirations and realise them to leave a mark through what they love. I work with them to

* gain **clarity of their own End Result**
* discover their **unique individual approach to it**
* uncover their **power to multiply their Impact**

I work [**One-to-One**](plans) with individual clients and run [**Impact Mastermind Groups**](plans), with[ **integrity**, **transparency** and **out-of-the-box thinking**](working-together), to help them achieve an exponential impact on all of their highest, unthinkable aspirations.

(I work with clients in English, Spanish and Italian)

## Who is Leonardo

I am a profoundly curious creative thinker with a bias for action. I always ask myself **Why-What-How**: _“Why things are how they are, what can we do to change them for the better, how can we take action now?“_

I am known in the maritime sector as the founder of [Startup Wharf](https://startupwharf.com), the first ever niche community of maritime startups, which has become a reference for the industry, helping startups make the maritime sector more sustainable.

I have repeatedly been a trailblazer in adopting technical innovation, process innovation and business innovation that eventually became new standards.

* I was the first to adopt digital technologies to design a ship’s hull in a way that made its manufacturing a great deal cheaper.
* I was the first to bring the Lean Startup concepts to Europe and launched a Lean Startup entrepreneurship course in parallel with the first similar course by Steve Blank in Silicon Valley.
* I turned around complex operations in a container terminal running 24/7 by successfully changing the infrastructure, tools and operating model on the go.

#### A Curious Creative Thinker With a Bias for Action

When I was a child I used to read a lot and asked millions of why and how questions. I was always thinking how to make things. As a pastime with my cousins, we would design and build new board games for us to play when we got tired of the existing ones. I always kept my hands dirty by inventing and making objects using wood, steel, aluminium. The emotion of seeing an object that I envisioned, take shape under my hands is indescribable. The joy of using it day after day is ineffable.

I am a visionary who’s often been called a romantic by my colleagues, **and I always took it as a compliment!** Of course I have also been misunderstood, taken advantage of, betrayed, and at times bullied. That’s a price that I would pay again and again to be able to do the things that I did in my life.

The few times in my career when I chose money over passion I paid a hefty price. I need to follow my passion to gain the most, both personally and financially! Today I have a couple of moonshots that I want to achieve (who knows what will come next!):

* I want to achieve an exponential impact on Ocean Sustainability and Decarbonisation
* I want to sail solo on a route that no-one ever sailed before...

_Leonardo's unique strength is that he has both an entrepreneurial spirit and highly analytical mind. He is imaginative, innovative and not afraid of taking risks. But at the same time his rational, analytical side is reassuring. On top of that, his sense of humour and excellent interpersonal skills make him a real pleasure to work with."_

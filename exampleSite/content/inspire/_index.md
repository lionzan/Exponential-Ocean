Exponential Ocean **Inspire** is a project to inspire people, leaders, CEOs, entrepreneurs, philanthropists and companies, to find their own way to multiply exponentially their impact on Ocean Sustainability.

I want to inspire them with examples of people who successfully managed to have a multiplicative effect beyond their normal activity.

I am interviewing leaders and people from all walks of life to produce

* an interviews series
* a podcast
* a book
* a website
* and possibly a documentary

These will be targeted to

* the broad public
* leaders in various sectors
* companies willing to
  * go beyond green washing
  * achieve real impact
  * inspire and motivate their own people

### Leaders Interviews

Here's [my invite to leaders](/leaders-invite).

### Contributors

I invite people who can contribute to this project to get in touch and discuss what they can bring in, just contact me on [inspire@zangrando.com](mailto:inspire@zangrando.com "inspire@zangrando.com")

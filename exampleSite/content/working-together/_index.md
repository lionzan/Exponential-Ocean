## How we are going to work together

Every client is different, every interaction is different. I will be able to create the perfect programme for you after knowing you a bit better.

To this purpose we start with a 2 hours free coaching session where we come to know each other. It's not just me wanting to know you. You too want to experience a powerful coaching session with me. Both you and I want to see whether we are a good fit, whether there is good chemistry to help you achieve your objective.

#### Uncomfortable questions

I warn you that I might ask you uncomfortable questions, about things that you hide deep down inside. But don't be alarmed, I will always ask for your permission to dig deep and you will always be in the position to ask me to give you a break.

What I will not allow you or me to fall into, is complacency into a situation that is stopping you from achieving your true greatness.

I will help you to steer away from the things you _think_ you want to achieve, towards those that you really _want_ to achieve. These might be so well hidden deep inside that it could hurt digging them out. But it's well worth it.

#### Choosing the End Result

When you choose the right end result, the one that you really want to achieve, you will be able to move towards it using your creative power.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves! After our first session you and I will be able to tell whether you want to continue down the exploration or not. And if you'll decide to move ahead I will chart our path toward your greatness.
